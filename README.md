**Description of my project:**

I decided to do the 3D website track because I saw it as more aligned to my skills as aa designer and a beginner developer, but also challenging me in the 3D aspect.

**📝 Pre-Hackathon (July 10th)**
- Initial Research: I first did some analysis of Sip N' Play's social media and an audit of their website to get a better understanding of their business and therefore how best to market their website and address their needs.
- Mood Board + Color Palette: I used Canva to effectively pick out the colors of the photos I collected from Sip N' Play's social media
- Summarize Individual Page Needs: Created a bulleted list of needs/features based on the track requirements and items of improvement I noticed in my initial website audit
- Project Scoping + Action Plan: Since I understood we only get 24 hours to work on the project, I decided to plan out features in cupcake, birthday cake, and wedding cake to make sure I deliver the main requirements and can move onto other features if I have the time. I also created a quick action plan in my notes, so that I can stay on track throughout the hackathon.

**💻 During Hackathon (July 11th)** <br>
- Wire-framing [1 hr]: Did some quick wireframes for the main screens I needed to focus on: Visit page and Landing page. This helped me visually map out what I needed to do based on the project scoping from before. NOTE: The Menu page was important, but didn't plan this out as I didn't know how the Three.js would affect the UI, so I designed the Menu page later on in the hackathon.
- Creating the UI [1 hr]: Gathered some UI inspo on Dribble, specifically the restaurant and video game website UI inspiration. After marking which elements I want to use in my UI, I startd dsigning the final UI for the 3D website.
- Started Coding (and using Three.js)! [7 hrs]: Opened up Visual Studio Code because it has a Live Server option, so I can easily view my code. Not quite sure if Github's option is smoother since I'm a beginner, but went with what I knew for this hacakathon. Next, creatd a 'Codedex Hackathon' folder on my computer for me to add my HTML, CSS, and Javascript files, as well as images or other media, so I could start!
- Prepping For Submission [2 hrs]: Opened Github to create a public repo to submit the project. Here I'm also dealing with how to create a demo link 🤔



**💪 Challenges**

- Flexbox- Still trying to understand when to use flexbox vs grid and what are the different properties for each. Mainly used StackOverflow and read articles I found via google searches for what I needed more information on.
- How To Add the Three.js object into the tabs themselves- This was an issue I wasn't able to resolve in time as I met the project requirements in having a 3D object and needed to move onto trying to create and fix the calendar.
- Calendar- Mainly dealing with CSS Flexbox and Javascript. I researched how to get the base, but had to adjust it to the proejcts needs since it needed more visual cues for which days had events, adding the event content, as well as adjusting the original 5 days per week to 7 and fixing the alignment, so it was in the center of the div container.
- General troubleshooting- For example, I was trying to apply CSS styles to a webpage, but it wasn't showing up on the webpage. After about 15 minutes, I realized I didn't connect the HTML to the CSS file 😅 After I fixed it, my CSS styles were displaying!

**📚 What I learned**
- Coding for HTML and CSS takes way longer than I thought. The design might be fairly simple, but the coding takes a while, but then again it's a 24 hr hackathon lol
- Learning more about how Javacript is intgrated w/ HTML + CSS. Had to problem-solve a lot of connection issues here
- Javascript is needed for every little interaction. Learned you use Javascript for pop-ups!
