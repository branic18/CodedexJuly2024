## Project Details
**Choosen Track I've built** : Create a 3D website 🎲

**Tools Used**: <br>
🛠️ Dev Tools: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Three.js <br>
🎨 Design Tools: Figma, Canva

**Solo or with a Team?**: Solo 😎

**Description of my project:**

I decided to do the 3D website track because I saw it as more aligned to my skills, but also challenging me in the 3D aspect.

1. Initial Research: I first did some analysis of Sip N' Play's social media and an audit of their website to get a better understanding of their business and therefore how best to market their website and address their needs.
2. Mood Board + Color Palette: I used Canva to effectively pick out the colors of the photos I found from Sip N' Play's social media
    1. Take your time here and summarize what your project is all about. Describe what you did and why you choose to do it that way verse another way. Talk about which technologies you used, the challenges your team faced, anything else you think is important for the judges to know! 
    2. KEEP IN MIND: good descriptions are helpful to the judges when looking at your projects. Prepare us for what’s ahead 🙂
